Warm Hearts Kelowna is a pop-up seasonal charity designed to offer extra support as the year comes to a close. This year we're supporting **Kelowna Women's Shelter** and **Kelowna General Hospital - Pediatric Ward**. Read more about the families and general organizations you can direct your donations to by clicking the "Who We Support" button. 
  
Gifts must be dropped off by **Friday, December 17th, 2021** in order for them to be hand delivered to the families or organizations in time. If more convenient, online donations will also be accepted through [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/warm-hearts-donations-tickets-216087512567).

When you're ready, complete our google form by clicking [here](https://forms.gle/Dno15Jz4uVionoqx7) to let us know who you will be supporting this season. We're excited and humbled to be a part of Kelowna's loving community - thank you!
  
Unfortunately, as Warm Hearts is a small unregistered charity, we are unable to provide tax receipts.
