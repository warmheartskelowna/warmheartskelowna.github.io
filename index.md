Warm Hearts Kelowna is a pop-up seasonal charity designed to offer extra support as the year comes to a close. Gifts must be dropped off by **Friday, December 17th, 2021** in order for them to be hand delivered to the families or organizations in time. If more convenient, e-transfers made to warmheartskelowna@gmail.com will also be accepted - please use 'kelowna' as the password and include who you'd like to direct your donation to in the message box.

Read more about the families and general organizations you can direct your donations to by clicking the "Who We Support" button. 

When you're ready, complete our google form by clicking [here](https://forms.gle/Dno15Jz4uVionoqx7) to let us know who you will be supporting this season. We're excited and humbled to be a part of Kelowna's loving community - thank you!
  
Unfortunately, as Warm Hearts is a small unregistered charity, we are unable to provide tax receipts.
