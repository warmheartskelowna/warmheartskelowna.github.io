## Warm Hearts Kelowna

Warm Hearts Kelowna is a pop-up seasonal charity designed to offer less-privileged households extra support around as the year comes to a close. Families will remain anonymized as assistance is pursued throughout the community. 

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, support will be requested in the form of gift cards.

Gifts will be hand delivered to the families or organizations by **Saturday, December 18, 2021.**
